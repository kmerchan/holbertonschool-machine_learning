This repository contains work on projects for the Holberton Machine Learning Specialization, including math concepts, supervised learning models, unsupervised learning models, and reinforcement learning models. I have highlighted a few notable projects that are representative of my ML journey so far.  You can also click on the links to each category or project directory for more information.

## [math](/math)
This directory contains projects to build up the math skills needed for Machine Learning.
* [0x00. Linear Algebra](/math/0x00-linear_algebra)
* Notable Project: [0x01. Plotting](/math/0x01-plotting)
  * This project highlights plotting with Matplotlib to visually show data. <img src="https://i.ibb.co/M8SVLpF/Screenshot-2021-06-27-10-57-48-PM.png" alt="multiple graphs" border="0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F3c8Tcv/Screenshot-2021-06-27-10-55-34-PM.png" alt="graph of elevation with color spectrum" border="0">

  * This project utilized pre-weighted deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model architectures. The goal was to train and adjust the hyperparameters of the model to improve the accuracy of the model to classify images into one of ten categories.  For more details, please check out my [blog post](https://kelsiemerchant.medium.com/ml-transfer-learning-journal-d15c93306ff7) that documents my learning process through the project duration (one week).

* Notable Project: [0x0E. Time Series Forecasting](/supervised_learning/0x0E-time_series)
  * This project used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model the trends of past values of bitcoin and used the model to predict the future value of bitcoin.  This project also worked with preprocessing the data to clean up missing values, split the data into training, validation, and test data, and normalizing the data.
