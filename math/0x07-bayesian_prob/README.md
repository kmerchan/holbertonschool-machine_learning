# 0x07-bayesian_prob
This directory contains work with Bayesian Probability:

## Mandatory Tasks:
0. [Likelihood](/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/0-likelihood.py)
* Write a function that calculates the likelihood of obtainin the data given various hypothetical probabilities of severe side effects from cancer drug study.
1. [Intersection](/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/1-intersection.py)
* Write a function that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with various hypothetical probabilities.
2. [Marginal Probability](/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/2-marginal.py)
* Write a function that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data.
3. [Posterior](/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/3-posterior.py)
* Write a function that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data.
