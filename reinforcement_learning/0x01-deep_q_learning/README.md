# 0x01-deep_q_learning
This directory contains expands on Q-learning with neural networks to allow for deep reinforcement learning:

## Mandatory Tasks:
0. [Breakout](/reinforcement_learning/0x01-deep_q_learning/train.py)
* Write a Python script [`train.py`](/reinforcement_learning/0x01-deep_q_learning/train.py) that trains an agent that can play Atari's Breakout and saves the final policy network as `policy.h5`.
* Write a Python script [`play.py`](/reinforcement_learning/0x01-deep_q_learning/play.py) that can display a game played by the agent trained by [`train.py`](/reinforcement_learning/0x01-deep_q_learning/train.py) using GreedyQPolicy.
